It has two components: a semantic autograder for teachers and a suite of code conversion/documentation tools for students.\nSummary Teacher The main functionality of our project is the semantic autograder. Classically, autograders rely on black-box testing. This approach obviously works well for tasks like grading problem sets and exams but falls short in some other settings. Studies show that active participation in lectures boosts learning outcomes. To encourage this, profs might have students submit code for autograding live in lectures to incentivize participation. However, this can backfire, as the autograder forces students to write perfect code while also being introduced to a topic for the first time, which distracts them from actually learning.\nIdeally, an autograder would be able to tell that a student is writing code that, while not necessarily correct, shows that they understand the problem and roughly know what a solution might look like. To fill this void, we designed a semantics-based autograder. It uses GPT-3 to look at the contents of a student’s code submission and determine how closely it resembles a solution for the given problem. The benefits of using a natural language model, rather than classical text parsing and diffing, to solve this problem are manifest. First, the semantic autograder is able to extract meaning, rather than just structure, from code. This prevents false negatives from similar-looking functions, which can easily arise when a course enforces a common template for certain functions. It also prevents false positives when a problem allows for extremely diverse solutions that can vary wildly from what the instructor expects while still solving the problem.\nStudent In order to guide students in their code implementation and debugging process, our program offers 6 different functions. There are bug fixers, docstring generators and tools to improve code quality and conciseness by converting length for-loops into compact maps or list comprehensions. The docstring generator is very helpful for students to understand the functionality of cryptic and poorly documented code. Moreover, the time complexity calculator can be used as a revision tool by CS students.\nFix Code: Fixes syntactical errors in python code\nTime Complexity: Computes the time complexity of submitted snippet\nPy Docstring: Generates a Doc string for code\nLoop to PyStream: Converts Python for loops into streams\nLoop to List: Deduces the functional programming solution for a given algorithmic solution\nList to Loop: Deduces the iterative solution for a complementary functional programming solution\nTechnology Our implementation uses OpenAI’s Python API and a Flask backend. We considered using Django but felt that it was unncessarily heavy for our use case.\nRunning Unfortunately, OpenAI doesn’t allow projects using GPT-3 to be published without approval, which takes around two weeks. We are, however, allowed to share pre-generated results, as we did in our demonstration video. Additionally, if you have an API key, you are free to run our code and verify our results. Simply clone the repository, add your key as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY, and run comparisons/comparison_functions.py.

However, training the bot would still take forever with the only existing option - running a local Pokemon Showdown server and interfacing with it. To solve this problem, I devised Project Lance: a locally-run Python implementation of Generation I Pokemon battles. With it, I was able to run about 2000 full battles per second on my CPU, as opposed to the couple dozen I could run by interfacing with Showdown in that same time. To further improve training speed, I implemented a multicore evaluator for self-play.
