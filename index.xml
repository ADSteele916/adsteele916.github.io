I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee all of these are necessarily good resources to pick up a new skill or improve an existing one. All I can say is that each of these resources either broadened or deepened my understanding of their respective subjects.&lt;/p>

Every year, high schools from across British Columbia send teams of students to compete in a series of physics-themed events. There are a couple of pre-built events, where students design some contraption; a lab event, where they need to apply what they learned to measure some quantity experimentally; Quizzics, where students answer rapid-fire physics and astronomy-related trivia; and Fermi questions, where they apply their knowledge of physics to give order-of-magnitude estimates for various fun problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fermi questions are named after the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, who was famously able to provide order-of-magnitude estimates for seemingly impossible-to-compute figures, like the number of piano tuners in New York City, the blast yield of the Trinity test, or the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy with which we could potentially communicate. The objective is to come up with a series of trivial estimates that can be multiplied together to obtain a decent estimate of a highly non-trivial problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fermi questions were always my favourites back when I competed in high school. For the past three years, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped design and test them. This usually involves me and &lt;a href="https://github.com/RioWeil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rio Weil&lt;/a> coming up with a bunch of ideas for different quantities to estimate, then trying to determine different ways to arrive at them. Our criteria for good questions is that they must be non-elementary, robust, and doable on a calculator. By non-elementary, we just mean that it&amp;rsquo;s not a question one would see in a high school physics textbook where a student could just use a known formula and constants, together with given quantities, to obtain an answer. The solver needs to make a non-obvious estimate, or apply some sort of university-level knowledge. Robustness is determined by whether or not different approaches converge to the same answer. This usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem when questions are specifically-worded enough, but it can still be problematic if the solution is highly sensitive to how one chooses to model the problem. Finally, since students aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed calculators, we try to ensure that the questions don&amp;rsquo;t rely on any transcendental functions (save for the trigonometric functions that everyone has memorized) or complicated square roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We usually come up with a set of problems that trend upward in difficulty. The first question is usually a matter of making one or two (possibly slightly unintuitive) estimates and combining them using simple formulas from high school physics. The last question, however, will typically require students to come up with a more complex model or have knowledge of advanced physics (that a particularly keen AP or IB student might be expected to have).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it would be interesting to walk through the process of designing a problem. Since all of the problems from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s event were solved live by Jeorg Rottler at the end of the day, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a question that Rio and I tried to make work for a while, but ended up putting aside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inspiration for this question came from the &lt;a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Relativistic Baseball&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> article on xkcd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>What If?&lt;/em> blog. I was curious about how quickly a baseball would need to be thrown to replicate the effects described in the article (namely, a small nuclear blast). To be more concrete, I phrased the question as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How fast would one need to throw a baseball in order for its impact to release as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima? Assume no air resistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The question, in its current state, requires the estimation of two quantities: the mass of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_%28ball%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseball&lt;/a> and the yield of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Boy&lt;/a>. This alone does not make for an interesting problem. However, I was hoping that, like in xkcd, special relativity would come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of an object is given by the expression $\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity. Therefore, solving this problem classically is simply a matter of substituting one&amp;rsquo;s estimates into $v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{\text{blast}}}{m}}$, where $E_{\text{blast}}$ is the yield of the Hiroshima bomb. However, when $v$ is close to the speed of light, this relation breaks down and we must, instead, turn to special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total relativistic energy of an object is given by $\gamma m c^2$, where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ is the so-called Lorentz factor, which is equal to $1$ for a stationary object and diverges to infinity as $v$ approaches $c$, the speed of light. To obtain the object&amp;rsquo;s relativistic kinetic energy, we simply subtract off its rest mass energy $E_0 = mc^2$ (this is obtained from the total relativistic energy formula by setting $v = 0$) and obtain $T = E - E_0 = (\gamma - 1) m c^2$ (as a fun exercise, one can derive the classical $T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ by taking a first-order Taylor approximation of this quantity). Note that we are using relativistic kinetic energy, not total energy. The rest mass energy of a baseball is enough for several hundred Hiroshima bombs, and the question never states that the baseball will be disintegrated down to its last atom. Rearranging to solve for $v$, we find:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\begin{align}
T = E_{\text{blast}} &amp;amp;= (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \newline
\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1 &amp;amp;= \gamma \newline
\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1 &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \newline
\frac{1}{\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1} &amp;amp;= \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \newline
\frac{1}{\left(\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1\right)^2} &amp;amp;= 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \newline
1 - \frac{1}{\left(\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1\right)^2} &amp;amp;= \frac{v^2}{c^2} \newline
\frac{\left(\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1\right)^2 - 1}{\left(\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1\right)^2} &amp;amp;= \frac{v^2}{c^2} \newline
c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\left(\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1\right)^2 - 1}}{\frac{E_{\text{blast}}}{m c^2} + 1} &amp;amp;= v
\end{align}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Needless to say, the use of special relativity propels this problem from being too easy to be the first question to being a potential final problem, just by virtue of it requiring knowledge of relativistic energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we still have not determined whether the desired appreciable distinction between the two approaches actually exists. Solving classically, we find a velocity of $2.8927 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$. Using special relativity, we instead obtain $2.8826 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$. While one could fairly easily use this question in a setting where calculators are allowed, three digits of precision is too much to ask for on a Fermi question. The differences between speeds calculated using slightly different bomb yields would be far greater than the difference between the classical and relativistic approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I resolved this problem by changing the energy we were comparing against. Instead of Little Boy, I substituted the energies released by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsar Bomba&lt;/a> (50 megatonnes), the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Krakatoa eruption&lt;/a> (200 megatonnes), and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asteroid impact&lt;/a> that is hypothesized to have caused the dinosaurs&amp;rsquo; extinction (100 teratonnes). All of these energy releases result in massive differences between the classical and relativistic results. The classical results are impossibly large (i.e. faster than the speed of light), while the relativistic results converge to values slightly lower than the speed of light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this brings us to another issue of precision, as the correct values would be virtually indistinguishable from the speed of light with only one or two digits of precision. A student could just calculate a speed of $1.6701 \times 10^{9} \text{ m/s}$ (for equivalence to the Tsar Bomba) classically, note that his or her result is much greater than the speed of light, and then simply guess $2.998 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$ without doing any of the relativistic calculations that we just covered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this question to work, two criteria had to be met. First, there must be a classical error significant enough to notice at one digit of precision, such that taking the relativistic approach is rewarded. Second, the relativistic speed must be distinguishable from the speed of light. Also, it would be nice if the classical speed was less than the speed of light, to make the need for using relativity non-obvious. After &lt;a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d1b5wlk9uj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some messing around on Desmos&lt;/a>, I determined that 5.581 megatonnes was about ideal, with a factor of two separating the relativistic and classical results. This still gave us a relativistic result of $0.931c$, with a classical result well over the speed of light, however.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, this question could still have been a candidate. It would have a pretty glaring weakness in that simply guessing the speed of light would likely give at least part marks (for first digit accuracy), but that isn&amp;rsquo;t highly likely to occur to a student with a time limit of five minutes. However, the last nail in its coffin was that there just wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything all that interesting that released 5.581 megatonnes of energy. Anything we could come up with that wasn&amp;rsquo;t incredibly obscure required several more layers of estimations that the students probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have time to make. For this reason, we ended up scrapping the nuclear baseball question in favour of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was a brief overview of the design and testing process that goes into writing a Fermi question, along with some hopefully interesting physics. If you happen to be a UBC student in the physics department (or even one outside it with an interest in physics) and you found this compelling, consider volunteering to help organize the Physics Olympics next year. More ideas (and hands) are always welcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Au Delà</title><link>https://alexdsteele.com/project/au-dela/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexdsteele.com/project/au-dela/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our project explores the use of GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s comprehension of code semantics in the setting of CS education. It has two components: a semantic autograder for teachers and a suite of code conversion/documentation tools for students.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="teacher">Teacher&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The main functionality of our project is the semantic autograder. Classically, autograders rely on black-box testing. This approach obviously works well for tasks like grading problem sets and exams but falls short in some other settings. Studies show that active participation in lectures boosts learning outcomes. To encourage this, profs might have students submit code for autograding live in lectures to incentivize participation. However, this can backfire, as the autograder forces students to write perfect code while also being introduced to a topic for the first time, which distracts them from actually learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, an autograder would be able to tell that a student is writing code that, while not necessarily correct, shows that they understand the problem and roughly know what a solution might look like. To fill this void, we designed a semantics-based autograder. It uses GPT-3 to look at the contents of a student&amp;rsquo;s code submission and determine how closely it resembles a solution for the given problem. The benefits of using a natural language model, rather than classical text parsing and diffing, to solve this problem are manifest. First, the semantic autograder is able to extract meaning, rather than just structure, from code. This prevents false negatives from similar-looking functions, which can easily arise when a course enforces a common template for certain functions. It also prevents false positives when a problem allows for extremely diverse solutions that can vary wildly from what the instructor expects while still solving the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="student">Student&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In order to guide students in their code implementation and debugging process, our program offers 6 different functions. There are bug fixers, docstring generators and tools to improve code quality and conciseness by converting length for-loops into compact maps or list comprehensions. The docstring generator is very helpful for students to understand the functionality of cryptic and poorly documented code. Moreover, the time complexity calculator can be used as a revision tool by CS students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Fix Code:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Fixes syntactical errors in python code&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Time Complexity:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Computes the time complexity of submitted snippet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Py Docstring:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Generates a Doc string for code&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Loop to PyStream:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Converts Python for loops into streams&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Loop to List:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Deduces the functional programming solution for a given algorithmic solution&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>List to Loop:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Deduces the iterative solution for a complementary functional programming solution&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="technology">Technology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our implementation uses OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Python API and a Flask backend. We considered using Django but felt that it was unncessarily heavy for our use case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running">Running&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, OpenAI doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow projects using GPT-3 to be published without approval, which takes around two weeks. We are, however, allowed to share pre-generated results, as we did in our demonstration video. Additionally, if you have an API key, you are free to run our code and verify our results. Simply clone the repository, add your key as an environment variable named &lt;code>OPENAI_API_KEY&lt;/code>, and run &lt;code>comparisons/comparison_functions.py&lt;/code>. Here are the expected results:&lt;/p>

However, training the bot would still take forever with the only existing option - running a local Pokemon Showdown server and interfacing with it. To solve this problem, I devised Project Lance: a locally-run Python implementation of Generation I Pokemon battles. With it, I was able to run about 2000 full battles per second on my CPU, as opposed to the couple dozen I could run by interfacing with Showdown in that same time. To further improve training speed, I implemented a multicore evaluator for self-play. This allowed me to train a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEAT&lt;/a> model to play optimally on a simplified version of the full battle engine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spacetime Calculator</title><link>https://alexdsteele.com/project/spacetime-calculator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexdsteele.com/project/spacetime-calculator/</guid><description>&lt;p>This Swing application allows users to plot events in two-dimensional spacetime. It demonstrates how events transform between reference frames, and how concepts such as simultaneity or two events being in the same place are frame-dependent. Additionally, it allows users to calculate how far two events are from each other in spacetime; whether they are timelike, spacelike, or null separated; and whether they appear to be simultaneous or in the same place in a given frame.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TSL Interpreter</title><link>https://alexdsteele.com/project/tsl-interpreter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexdsteele.com/project/tsl-interpreter/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is just a fun little project I made over the August long weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s a parser and interpreter for the &amp;ldquo;Tiny Student Language&amp;rdquo;, a sublanguage of &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racket&lt;/a>. I made it as an accessible, high-level demonstration of how programming languages work. As such, it has very few built-in types and functions. However, it is still capable of correctly evaluating recursive and higher-order functions, and, theoretically, can traverse trees and graphs using mutually-recursive functions (this would be rather ugly and inefficient due to the absence of define-struct and local though). I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on adding new features to TSL in the future, so as to keep it simple, but I would like to expand its error handling, so imperfect code doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause an instant crash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UBC Course Monitor</title><link>https://alexdsteele.com/project/ubc-course-monitor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexdsteele.com/project/ubc-course-monitor/</guid><description>&lt;p>UBC Course Monitor is a web application that I built to help fellow UBC students find open seats in courses they want to take. Users can sign up to monitor any course section publically listed on the University of British Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Student Services Centre. Once they add the course to their list, they will receive an email notification when a seat opens up. The backend of the site was built using the Django framework and uses a Celery queue to do background monitoring. The application is deployed on Heroku and uses a PostgreSQL database to manage users and courses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UBC Rocket Ground Station</title><link>https://alexdsteele.com/project/ubc-rocket-ground-station/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexdsteele.com/project/ubc-rocket-ground-station/</guid><description>&lt;p>My primary role in UBC Rocket is contributing to the development of our rockets&amp;rsquo; ground station software, which is used to remotely control the functioning of flight-critical and data collection electronics onboard and display any data received from the rocket. It is developed in Python using PyQt5 as a GUI framework. I optimized the ground station&amp;rsquo;s mapping functionality to allow it to update in real-time by implementing multithreading. I also designed and implemented an automated unit- and integration-testing framework using PyTest to ensure code correctness.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
