Hello! I'm Alex, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in May 2024. My interests include embedded and low-level software development, reinforcement learning, and robotic motion control.

I'm currently working on my Honours Thesis with Michiel van de Panne. I'm also the lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, UBCâ€™s major-stream introductory computer science course, where I develop plagiarism detection algorithms and lead a team of TAs who work on infrastructure.

In my free time, I contribute to the [UBC Rocket](https://www.ubcrocket.com/) design team as a senior member of the avionics subteam, enjoy some [light reading](/reading), and work on various [side projects](#projects). I also help plan and volunteer at [UBC's annual Physics Olympics competition](/post/how-fast-would-one-have-to-throw-a-baseball-to-replicate-a-nuclear-blast/).

In the past, I've spent eight months as a crash safety software engineer intern at Tesla, four months as a numerical methods research assistant in UBC's Numerical Linear Algebra Lab, and eight months as a satellite software engineer intern at Kepler Communications.
