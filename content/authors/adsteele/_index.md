Hello! I'm Alex, a software engineer specializing in embedded and systems programming.

I currently work at Tesla, where I optimize the distributed vehicle simulations that validate the safety of all software rolled out to vehicles. My main professional interest is designing high-performance systems responsible for mission-critical decisions. More concretely, I enjoy working on embedded firmware, high-performance applications, and AI (specifically reinforcement learning) systems. In previous roles, I've written safety-critical firmware for responding to automotive crashes, magnetohydrodynamic simulation software, and a satellite firmware image deployment system.

I received my Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Physics from the University of British Columbia in May 2024. In my final year, I completed my thesis on reinforcement learning for snake-like robots under the supervision of Professor Michiel van de Panne. I was also the lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, the university's major-stream introductory computer science course, for four years. As part of that role, I developed a high-performance code similarity detection system capable of comparing tens of millions of pairs of assignment submissions, which is now in use across the department.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat. The best way to get ahold of me is via email.
