My primary role in UBC Rocket is contributing to the development of our rockets' ground station software, which is used to remotely control the functioning of flight-critical and data collection electronics onboard and display any data received from the rocket. It is developed in Python using PyQt5 as a GUI framework. I optimized the ground station's mapping functionality to allow it to update in real-time by implementing multithreading. I also designed and implemented an automated unit- and integration-testing framework using PyTest to ensure code correctness.
