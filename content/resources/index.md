I'm asked about how I learned about various topics in my majors with some regularity, so I figured that some might find it helpful if I started to compile a list of learning resources that I found useful. They vary in formality from textbooks and online courses to blogs and videos. I can't guarantee all of these are necessarily good resources to pick up a new skill or improve an existing one. All I can say is that each of these resources either broadened or deepened my understanding of their respective subjects.

## Computer Science

### Data Structures and Algorithms

* Kleinberg and Tardos' *Algorithm Design*

* McDowell's *Cracking the Coding Interview*

### Computer Systems

* Bryant and O'Hallaron's *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*

* The YouTube video ["Fast Inverse Square Root — A Quake III Algorithm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8u_k2LIZyo) provides a surprisingly good overview of floating-point number representations.

### Numerical Methods

* Ascher and Greif's *A First Course in Numerical Methods*

### Machine Learning

* DeepLearning.AI's ["Deep Learning Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera provides a decent overview of machine learning techniques, albeit one devoid of much theory.

* Russel and Norvig's *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*

* Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

* UBC's machine learning courses have made their materials [publically available on GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-CS)

* [*Dive into Deep Learning*](https://d2l.ai/index.html) is a fairly comprehensive overview of deep neural networks written by a team of Amazon researchers.

### Software Engineering

* Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin, the author of *Clean Code* and *Clean Architecture* gave [a series of excellent talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj) on software development and project management that I would highly recommend.

* Even as someone who has never played the game and frankly has little interest in game development, the [*Factorio* development blog](https://www.factorio.com/blog/) has many interesting articles on the development process. I particularly enjoyed reading their articles on optimizations they made to allow the game to run as well as it does.

### Programming Languages

#### Python

* Raymond Hettinger's PyCon 2015 talk ["Beyond PEP 8 — Best practices for beautiful intelligible code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)

* [*The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns*](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/)

#### C/C++

* Koffman and Wolfgang's *Objects, Abstraction, Data Structures and Design: Using C++*

##### Build Systems

* Craig Scott's [*Professional CMake: A Practical Guide*](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/)

* [*An Introduction to Modern CMake*](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/)

## Mathematics

### General

* Riley, Hobson, and Bence's *Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering* provides a good overview of common mathematical techniques and serves its purpose well as a general reference for most math one might end up needing in physics.

### Calculus

* James Stewart's *Calculus* (or *Calculus: Early Transcendentals*) was my main resource for learning the subject in AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, and my second year multivariable and vector calculus course. There are many free textbooks available online ([UBC's CLP](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/) earns a dishonourable mention), but none of them compare to Stewart's approachability, intuitiveness, and challenging problems, in my experience.

* Schey's *Div, Grad, Curl, and All That* is an excellent supplement to Stewart's chapters on vector calculus. I found myself consulting it with some regularity in my electricity and magnetism course.

* 3blue1brown's [*Essence of Calculus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

### Linear Algebra

* Lay's *Linear Algebra and Its Applications*

* Friedberg, Insel, and Spence's *Linear Algebra*

* 3blue1brown's [*Essence of Linear Algebra*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

### Proofs

* Hammack's [*Book of Proof*](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)

* Aigner's *Proofs from THE BOOK*

### Differential Equations

* Lebl's [*Notes on Diffy Qs*](https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/)

* Paul's Online Math Notes has a decent [set of class notes on ordinary differential equations](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/de/de.aspx)

* Boyce and DiPrima's *Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems*

### Probability

* Ross' *Introduction to Probability Models*

* Anderson, Seppäläinen, and Valkó's *Introduction to Probability*

## Physics

### General

* Feynman's *Six Easy Pieces* and *Six Not-So-Easy Pieces*

### Elementary Physics

* Chabay and Sherwood's *Matter and Interactions*

* Halliday, Resnick, and Walker's *Fundamentals of Physics*

### Relativity

* Helliwell's *Special Relativity*

### Classical Mechanics

* Taylor's *Classical Mechanics*

### Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

* Schroeder's *An Introduction to Thermal Physics*

### Electricity and Magnetism

* Griffiths' *Introduction to Electrodynamics*

### Quantum Mechanics

* Griffiths and Schroeter's *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*

* Susskind and Friedman's *Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum*
